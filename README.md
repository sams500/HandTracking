# HandTracking
A program that detect and track hands using some predefined landmarks. Those landmarks can be used to accomplish many tasks with the laptop depending on the position of the hands. 
I hope to aextend this program with many more amazing tasks. 

To achive this, I used [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for video capturing, and a free library offered by Google, [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/).
